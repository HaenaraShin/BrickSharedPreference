ðŸ”’ EncryptedSharedPreferences Migration Support Library For Android.

# Introduce

Simple way to keep your SharedPreferences secure and safe.

Support migration legacy SharedPreferences to EncryptedSharedPreferences.

- **Require minSdk 14.**

# How To Use


## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.haenara:bricksharedpref:1.0.2'
    implementation "androidx.security:security-crypto:1.0.0-alpha02"
}
```

## How to Migrate

When you encrypt existing plain-text data and get rid of legacy plain-text data, follow this method:
```
BrickSharedPreferences.migrateEncryptedSharedPreferences()
```
And all is done! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Access EncryptedSharedPreferences

After migration, use a BrickSharedPreferences instance instead of SharedPreferences.

All you have to do is changing codes like this:  

### Kotlin

```
// Only difference is adding "Brick" when you get SharedPreferences. 
mSharedPreferences = context.getBrickSharedPreferences(fileName, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
```

### Java

```
mSharedPreferences = new BrickSharedPreferences(context, fileName);
```
And all is done! ðŸŽ‰

BrickSharedPreferences deletes the legacy SharedPreferences file, and copies and encrypts as a new file name start with  "brick_".

After migration, just use a BrickSharedPreferences instance instead of SharedPreferences.
