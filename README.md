BrickSharedPreferences deletes the legacy SharedPreferences file, and copies and encrypts as a new file name start with  "brick_".

After migration, just use a BrickSharedPreferences instance instead of SharedPreferences. 


## How to Migrate

When you encrypt existing plain-text data and get rid of legacy plain-text data, follow this method:
```
BrickSharedPreferences.migrateEncryptedSharedPreferences()
```
And all is done! ðŸŽ‰

## How to Access EncryptedSharedPreferences

After migration, use a BrickSharedPreferences instance instead of SharedPreferences.

All you have to do is changing codes like this:  

```
// Only difference is adding "Brick" when you get SharedPreferences. 
mSharedPreferences = getBrickSharedPreferences(fileName, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
```
And all is done! ðŸŽ‰
